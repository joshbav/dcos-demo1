THIS IS A PRIVATE REPO, for myself and my coworkers.  

THIS ISN'T READY TO USE YET!

NOTES: 
1. This script might not be up to date, perhaps newer packages like edge-lb, kubernetes, etc now exist.  
2. I often use older packages so I can demo the upgrade process.  


TO USE:  
1. Setup a cluster in CCM of at least 7 nodes.  
2. Copy to the clipboard the dashboard URL from CCM.  
3. ./runme (paste dashboard URL)  [don't press enter]  
4. Copy to the clipboard the ELB URL from CCM, and paste it as the next parameter on the runme cli above. Thus the command will be in the form ./runme URL1 URL2   

JOSH'S TO DO LIST:
