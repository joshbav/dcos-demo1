3-20-18 UPDATE:

Added kubernetes GA to auto install (all defaults)

Updated cassandra autoinstall to be 2nd to most recent version

Renamed script from dcosnew to runme

Removed hard coded paths in the script, you must run runme.sh from it's folder, but it still assumes the CCM ssh key is ~/ccm-priv.key

Added example-dependency.json, which is a marathon group (2 apps tied together)

TODO: ssh-add ~/ccm-priv.key, not included in repo

TODO: Created user1, user2, team1 and team2 (groups), secrets for the groups, and marathon folders for the teams
